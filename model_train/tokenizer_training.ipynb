occurs in sterling integrator for clocking purpose and to track the issue progress. now i am part of production support/bau phase activities where i check for errors in si dashboard and error notification emails from si and from business/customers. venkatesh gunuru ibridge techsoft jul 2019 feb 2022 roles and responsibilities i worked for a production support team where i handled multiple errors by fixing mapping issues and reporting to customers and reporting to sap team to correct the master data. i worked on multiple enhancement/change requests to fix the data issues in production. part of mailbox team and i got the chance to work on as2 and sftp for multiple partner onboarding. multiple as2 partner configurations done by acquiring partner as2 profile details document and their certificates. i have created as2 contracts and as2 relationships and tested them in a lower environment before moving the setup to production. ip whitelisted is the initial process we follow where we send request to network team to whitelist partner ip s. miracle software systems apr 2015 may 2019 roles and responsibilities i worked on multiple projects here and got a chance to do end-to-end development testing and production deployment. in case of new setup i am responsible for setting up the trading partner profile and creating new maps and testing each transaction end to end and in case of any questions i use to reach the customer. i am responsible for creating the test orders in our backend application for testing purposes in customized tool of customer. i worked on migration projects the backend application got upgraded to a new application and there were few interfaces based on the existing maps. i have done reverse engineering and redeveloped the maps which support the new backend application. i gained quite a good knowledge of dealing with the customer in terms of handling the project. i am also involved in production support activities of the project which went live. mahle is a migration project and it is a timeline-based project in which i did huge number of normal and database maps which were modified and deployed into new test server. venkatesh gunuru along with the maps i also worked on modification of existing flows in developing generic business processes. i also worked on creating supporting services and setups for successful testing results. analysis of the requirement and multiple documents and excel sheets are updated with the information related to configurations i did and testing results are captured and compare reports too. once the development is completed i do multiple tests runs locally and in sterling integrator to check if data and process is working as expected. completing testing and capturing the test results is key to getting approvals to move the artifacts to production. i worked on production support issues where i needed to resolve issues of maps on time business processes and envelop setup issues or service issues. i hereby declare that all the information provided above is true to my knowledge.',\n",
